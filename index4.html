      <h2><a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm">Yellowstone National Park | Idaho, Montana, & Wyoming</a></h2>
      <p>Known for its geothermal activity, vast array of wildlife, and diverse landscape, Yellowstone National Park is unlike any other. Spanning across Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, the heart of this national park is a dormant super volcano, which when last active reshaped the region to as we see today. This supervolcano is so massive that visitors in the park can explore the caldera that is now covered with lush green vegetation and wildlife. From geothermal bubbling hot springs, active geysers blasting steaming water, waterfalls, mountains and canyons, Yellowstone is a place like none other. Not only is the landscape impressive, the wildlife boasts an impressive array including grizzlies, buffalo, elf, bighorn sheep, and bobcats to name a few. With over 2 million acres of terrain and wildlife, Yellowstone offers something new each time you visit, leaving visitors coming back to enjoy its beauty and wonder.   </p>
