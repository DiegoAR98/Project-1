      <h2><a href="https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm">Glacier National Park | Washington</a></h2>
      <p>With a vast array of natural beauty, Glacier National Park secures the number one slot for best U.S. National Park for 2023. Rich history and spectacular geological features are the heart of this park that spans over one million acres. Visitors can take a trip back in time when visiting the National Historic Landmark, a scenic drive through the park called “Going-to-the-Sun Road” as well as buildings created in the early 20th century by the Great Northern Railway. The park packs a punch with two mountain ranges, a vast amount of waterfalls and lakes, along with a variety of wildlife that call this park home. While Glacier National Park is open year round, the peak season is from July - August as those months boast warmer & drier weather. Activities of all experience, ability, and weather are available from skiing, boating, and hiking to tours, wheelchair accessible trails, and snowshoeing. This is definitely a park anyone should check off their list. </p>
