      <p>In the southwest corner of Utah, is a breathtaking sanctuary that inspired that parkâ€™s name of Zion which means refuge. Zion is one of the most visited parks in the U.S., with tourists who just can't get enough of this rock zen terrain. The park boasts an array of ways to view Zion Canyon astonishing views, from wading down in the river, or  as you climb up Angels Landing. Not only does the park have awe inspiring views during the day, its also a spectacular place to stargaze the brightly shining darts that blanket the sky when the sun has set and the moon rises.
