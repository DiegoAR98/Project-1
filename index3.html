      <h2><a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm">Grand Canyon National Park | Arizona</a></h2>
      <p>A truly natural wonder, located in Arizona, the Grand Canyon is a treasure not to be missed. For millions of years the Grand Canyon has expanded as the Colorado River snakes through the landscape. Make no mistake, the “Grand” Grand Canyon lives up to its reputation as visitors look over the vast winding red-orange canyon. With a length of over 270 river miles, with a width stretching up to 18 miles and depth of up to a mile, there is much to explore and see both above and down in the canyon.  The park also offers a more heavily traveled tourist part, the South Rim, as well as a less heavily populated part, the North Rim. Whether you want to hike the river beds down in the mile deep canyons, or take a helicopter ride to get a bird’s eye view, the Grand Canyon National Park will be a one of a kind grand adventure.</p>
